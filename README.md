# KernelICA for Identification of Structural Innovations in Multivariate Time Series Models

This repository contains the code used in the implementation of the methodology described in my Master's thesis titled **"KernelICA for Identification of Structural Innovations in Multivariate Time Series Models."** The code is adapted and extended from the original implementation by Moneta, A., & Pallante, G. in their paper titled *"Identification of Structural VAR Models via Independent Component Analysis: A Performance Evaluation Study"* (LEM Working Paper Series, No. 2020/24, 2020).
